# Update 2-25-2023: The list called "paranoid" is no longer that.  It's now used on a device that is to have normal blocking.  For a more paranoid list, use the generic filter.list, instead.

# Lists contains various domain and IP black / white lists.  I also used to maintain a rolling set of the last 10 days of registered domains, however I have discontinued that and those lists will now have one placeholder domain.  The work involved well outweighed the benefit in my opinion.

# At this point, this repo is not really intended for the use of anyone but myself, but anyone that wants to use it may do so.  The lists may or may not be updated over time.
